# Ting-Yi Chen (陳庭毅)
I received the B.S. degree from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2020. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree, supported by the TSMC fellowship program, in Applied Mechanics at National Taiwan University. My current research projects include nonlinear dynamics in MEMS and event-driven acoustic resonant switches (resoswitches).
