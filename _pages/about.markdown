# Ting-Yi Chen
I received the B.S. degree from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2020. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute Applied Mechanics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. My current research projects include MEMS-based nonlinear resonators and event-driven acoustic resonant switches (resoswitches).
